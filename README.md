A script written on Python for scraping username, phone on telegram.  
It can be used for telegram blasting or inviting members to your group using [TeleInviter](https://github.com/ziziwho/teleinviter).  
This script can be run on Window's command prompt
and Termux terminal on Android.

## Overview
First of all, my name is [Zizi](https://github.com/ziziwho/). A few months ago zizi created a script to automatically invite members to the telegram groups but did not disclose how zizi was scraping the usernames on the telegram. So zizi has created a [TeleScraper](https://github.com/ziziwho/telescraper) to do that. [TeleScraper](https://github.com/ziziwho/telescraper) is a script where it is used to extract the usernames from groups on a telegram.
